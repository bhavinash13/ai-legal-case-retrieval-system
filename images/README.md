# Legal Images for Floating Banner

Place your legal-themed images in this directory with the following names:

- `legal_img-1.webp` - Gavel or hammer image
- `legal_img-2.webp` - Law book or legal document image  
- `legal_img-7.webp` - Scales of justice image
- `legal_img-8.webp` - Courthouse or legal building image

## Image Requirements:
- Format: WebP (recommended) or PNG/JPG
- Size: Approximately 90px width (will be resized automatically)
- Background: Transparent or white background preferred
- Theme: Legal/justice related icons or illustrations

## Fallback:
If local images are not found, the app will automatically use online legal icons from Flaticon as fallback.

## Usage:
The app automatically converts these images to base64 format for embedding directly in the HTML, ensuring fast loading and no external dependencies.
