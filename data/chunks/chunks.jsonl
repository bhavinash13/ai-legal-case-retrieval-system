Here A, whether the act be committed or\nnot, is guilty of abetting an offence. (b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here, though B was not capable\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. (c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to\nthe punishment provided for that offence.

A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death,\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z.

Secondly, the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the appropriate authority is entirely independent of any action by the Advisory Board including the consideration of the representation of the detenu by the Advisory Board. Thirdly, there should not be any delay in the matter of consideration. It is true\nthat no hard and fast rule can be laid down as to the measure of time taken by the\nappropriate authority for consideration but it has to be remembered that the\nGovernment has to be vigilant in the governance of the citizens. A citizen's right raises a correlative duty of the State. Fourthly, the appropriate Government is to\nexercise its opinion and judgment on the representation before sending the case along with the\ndetenu's representation to the Advisory Board. If the appropriate Government will release the\ndetenu the Government will not send the matter to the Advisory Board. If however, the Government\nwill not release the detenu the Government will send the case along with the detenu's representation\nto the Advisory Board. If thereafter the Advisory Board will express an opinion in favour of release\nof the detenu the Government will release the detenu."}

Indeed,\ncounsel for the petitioners very fairly submitted that they are not raising the question\nof delay. They also did not argue that the rejection of the representation after the\nconfirmation of detention was not an independent consideration. 11.

As long as the\ngovernment without delay considers the representation with an unbiased mind there is no basis for\nconcluding that the absence of independent consideration is the obvious result if the representation\nis not considered before the confirmation of detention. Indeed, there is no justification for imposing\nthis restriction on the power of the government. As observed earlier, the government's consideration\nof the representation is for a different purpose, namely, to find out whether the detention is in\nconformity with the power under the statute. This has been explained in Haradhan Saha case\n[(1975) 3 SCC 198 : 1974 SCC (Cri) 816 : (1975) 1 SCR 778] , where Ray, C.J., speaking for the\nConstitution Bench observed that the consideration of the representation by the government is only\nto ascertain whether the detention order is in conformity with the power under the law.

Union of India, (1995) 4 SCC 51 : 1995 SCC (Cri) 643] . 28. In the light of the aforesaid discussion, our answer to first two questions is that the detaining authority ought to have considered the representation independently and without waiting for the report of the Central Advisory Board. 29. We now come to the third question. The facts in the instant case indicate that the comments of\nthe sponsoring authority in respect of the representation were already received by the detaining\nauthority. RRR,J& TCDS,J After receipt of letter on 27-11-2019 that the detenues were received in custody, the\ntime for considering the representation started ticking for the detaining authority. But the\nrepresentation was considered only on 14-1-2020 and the reason for such delayed consideration is\nthat the report of the Central Advisory Board was awaited. We have already found that the detaining\nauthority was obliged to consider the representation without waiting for the opinion of the Central\nAdvisory Board. Thus, there was no valid explanation for non-consideration of the representation\nfrom 27-11-2019 till 14-1-2020. We must, therefore, hold that complete inaction on the part of the\ndetaining authority in considering the representation caused prejudice to the detenues and violated\ntheir constitutional rights. 30."}

O.S.No.667 of 1990 was compromised on 09.09.1993 in I.A.No.5904 of 1993 and a compromise decree was passed, agreeing to give an amount of Rs.5,50,000/- to the 2nd plaintiff therein, on humanitarian grounds, in full and final settlement of all the claims whatsoever of the plaintiff No.1 and plaintiff No.2 in the estate of the deceased Kesava Rao. The defendant's further case was that after passing the compromise\ndecree, Chennupathi Pushpavathi mobilized funds to deposit the amount in the name of the plaintiff\nbut at that time Chennupathi Manikyamba and her father requested Chennupathi Pushpavathi and\nthe present defendant to give some property instead of cash as agreed in the compromise decree\ndated 09.09.1993, which was refused. 8. Defendant-respondent's further case was that another O.S.No.552 of 1994 was filed by the\nplaintiff through next friend, the maternal grandfather namely Mande Nageswara Rao, to set aside\nthe compromise decree passed in O.S.No.667 of 1990.

Learned counsel for the respondent placed reliance in C.N.

In C.N. Ramappa Gowda (supra), the Hon'ble Apex Court held that assertion is no proof and\nhence, the burden lay on the plaintiff to prove even if there was no written statement to the contrary\nor any evidence of rebuttal. 90. There cannot be any dispute on the proposition of law that even if the defendant does not file\nwritten statement or does not lead his evidence or even does not cross examine the plaintiff's\nwitnesses, still the plaintiff has to establish his case based on the evidence on record and the trial\ncourt has to record the reasons for proof of the plaintiff's case.

The said argument deserves rejection. The reason is that in the facts of the\npresent case, the plaintiff was required to prove that there was marriage between Chennupati\nKesava Rao and Manikyamba @ Mani; and that he was born of that marriage. The plaintiff's mother\n(PW 1) was the best witness to prove that.

The law, however, recognises cases where even after the disposal of the cardinal issues other matters have to be worked out before the whole case or suit can be determined. A number of such cases are mentioned in Order 20 of the CPC, as\ncases where a preliminary decree ought to be made at first, and a final decree at a\nlater stage. Dr. Gupta has contended that the cases mentioned in these rules of the\nCode of Civil Procedure are the only cases that can arty of cardinal issues being\ndetermined and other masters being left to be worked out subsequently, and that the\ndecision appealed from, not being covered by any of the rules mentioned in the Code\nof Civil Procedure which mention cases where preliminary decrees ought to be made\nthe order should not be held to be preliminary or interlocutory judgment.

I am unable to agree that these rules in Order 20 of the CPC give exhaustive list of\nall classes where preliminary judgments may be delivered by the Court. Reference\nmay be made in this connection to the weighty observations of the bench consisting\nof Mookerjee, J. and Rankin, J. in Peary Mohan Mookerjee v. Manohar Mookerjee,\n27 Cal WN 989 : (AIR 1924 Cal 160), in these words:--\n\"It is not essential that an adjudication should be covered by one of the specific cases\nof preliminary decrees mentioned in Or. XX of the Code in order that it may form the basis of a final decree; those cases are\nillustrations of preliminary decrees and help us in determining the true meaning of\nthe definition of the term \"decree.\" Whether the order made by the Judge possesses\nthe qualities of a decree, preliminary or final or partly preliminary and partly final,\nclearly depends upon its contents.\"\n110. We are therefore of the view that for doing complete justice between both the sides, an exercise\nto work out the shares by metes and bounds can be done in the present suit itself, instead of\nrelegating the parties to file a partition suit, to bring an end to the long drawn litigation since 1990\nalready stretched in three suits."}

If the plaintiff was declared the absolute owner, then on setting\naside the compromise decree, direction could have been given to the defendant to restore / deliver\nentire A-schedule property of O.S.No.179 of 2009, which was given to the defendant under the\ncompromise decree. 111. There is another reason, in a suit for partition, firstly there is adjudication of the shares of the\nparties. A preliminary decree is passed. Then the final decree is passed by metes and bounds. The\npresent is not a suit for partition. It is a suit for declaration and recovery of possession. But, in the\npresent suit, the adjudication of rights of the parties had already been done by the trial Court and\nalso by this Court determining their rights and respective shares, which is the same thing as is done\nin a suit for partition, vide a preliminary decree."}

In our view, what now remains is the division by\nmetes and bounds between the plaintiff and the defendant as per their respective shares. So, it\nwould be in the interests of justice as also the parties that, based on the decree to be passed in this\nAppeal, the learned trial Court may be directed to proceed in the present suit itself, for passing the\nfinal decree, like in a suit for partition. V. Conclusions: 112. We sum up as under:-\na) On point 'A', we hold that O.S.No.197 of 2009 filed\nby the plaintiff-appellant to set aside the compromise decree in O.S.No.552 of 1994 entered during\nthe minority of the plaintiff- appellant without sanction/leave of the court under Order 32 Rule 7\nC.P.C is not barred by Order 23 Rule 3A CPC.
